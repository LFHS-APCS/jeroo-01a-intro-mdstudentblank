Write code to have a single Jeroo start at (0,0) facing East.
Then, have it hop 5 spaces, plant a flower, and hop once more so you can see the flower.

IMPORTANT:  You can only use:
* ```hop()```
* ```plant()```


On https://jeroo.org, you will have to first write the following:

    method main() {
    
    }
and then put your code inside of this main method.

When it is working on https://jeroo.org, open the code by pressing on the "Work in Repl.it" button inside of the github project.

Copy the code that you wrote into the ```runJerooCode()``` method inside of Main.java.

You can try to run it in repl.it.  You need to use the left and right arrow keys to see the Jeroo move.

When you've seen that it works in repl.it,  select the version control tab. You can enter a description of what you changed and click on the commit&push button.

Your code should now be stored online.
